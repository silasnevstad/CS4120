MRN: 344645
In February 2020, a 46-year-old female patient presented with a growing palpable mass on the right parietal region with no any other  symptoms  or  history.
She  initially  visited  the  Second Hospital of Luohe City on February 4, 2020, and was examined by  one  physician  who  was  diagnosed  with  COVID-10  onFebruary  5,  2020  (Day  1,  was  in  contact  with  the  infected patient).
The diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma was confirmed by  bronchoscopic  biopsy,  and  the  mass  on  the  right parietal region  was  considered  metastatic.
The  patient  was  transferred to  Henan  Chest  Hospital  for  further  treatment  on  February  9, 2020  (Day  5).
Henan  Chest  Hospital  was  informed  that  this patient  had  been  in  contact  with  the  diagnosed  infected physician on February 14, 2020, and she immediately had chest CT   and   RT-PCR   tests   for   COVID-19   nucleic   acid   using nasopharyngeal  swabs.
Results  of  RT-PCR  testing  for  C  -19 nucleic  acid  were  positive  on  February  14,  2020  (Day  10), however, chest CT did not demonstrate typical reported signs of COVID-19.
The  patient  subsequently  developed  intermittent fever to 38°Celsius on the morning of February 15, 2020, and was  transferred  to  the  Sixth  People  Hospital  of  Zhengzhou, which  is  a  designated  hospital  for  COVID-19.
The  patient experienced intermittent chest tightness, nausea and vomiting, and she  received  treatment with traditional Chinese  medicine.
Chest  CT  scanning  was  performed  again  on  February  18,  2020 (Day 14), and no typical CT features  for COVID-19 were found.
RT-PCR tests for COVID-19 were repeated on February 18 (Day 18)  and  20  (Day  18),  2020,  and  both  were  negative.
She  had increased  C-reactive  protein  levels  and  reduced  lymphocyte ratios.
Her symptoms started to improve, and she was transferred to a general ward.
Chest   CT   images   showed   diffuse   irregular   small   diffuse ground-glass  nodular  opacities  with  partial  consolidation  in bilateral lungs on Day 10, in addition to the mass in  the  left  lung.
The  nodules  increased  in  size  and  number  on Day 14.
These diffuse irregular small ground-glass opacities with partial consolidation rapidly increased in 4 days in this patient with left lung  cancer,  which  were  consistent  with  inflammation,  rather than  metastasis.
Repeat  positive  RT-PCR  tests  for  nucleic  acid confirmed  the  diagnosis  of  COVID-19.
White  blood  cell  counts remained   elevated,   even   after   the   patient’s   symptoms improved,  likely  due  to  obstructive  pneumonia  caused  by  the tumor.
Chest  CT  images  showed  diffuse  irregular  small  ground-glass opacities with partial consolidation in bilateral lungs on Day 10, in  addition  to  the  mass  in  the  left  lung.
The  nodular  opacities increased  in  size  and  number  on  Day  14,  which  was  not  a typically  reported  COVID-19  feature  including  ground  glass opacity  (GGO),  crazy-paving  pattern,  and  consolidation(3,4).
The  typical  distribution  of  lung  abnormalities  in  COVID-19  was reported  as  predominantly  subpleural;  however,   this  case showed predominantly diffuse involvement.
