# [--- 1. Random Initialization ---]
# In random initialization, cluster centroids are randomly selected from the dataset.
# This method is straightforward to implement and is commonly used as a starting point in algorithms like K-means.

# === Pros ===
# Simplicity: It's very easy to implement and doesn't require complex computations upfront.
# Speed: Since it randomly picks centroids from the dataset, it's fast and doesn't add significant computational overhead.

# === Cons ===
# Inconsistency: The quality of the final clusters can vary significantly because it heavily depends on the initial
# random centroids. You might need to run the algorithm multiple times to get a satisfactory result.
# Risk of Poor Convergence: There's a higher risk of converging to suboptimal solutions, especially if the randomly
# chosen centroids are not well-distributed across the dataset.

# [--- 2. K-means++ Initialization ---]
# K-means++ is an algorithm for choosing the initial values for the K-means clustering algorithm.
# It's designed to improve the convergence rate and the quality of the final clusters by spreading out the initial
# centroids before proceeding with the standard K-means optimization iterations.

# === Pros ===
# Improved Clustering Quality: By carefully choosing initial centroids, K-means++ tends to find better clusterings than
# random initialization.
# Better Convergence: It often requires fewer iterations to converge, reducing the overall computational cost.

# === Cons ===
# Computational Overhead: The initial selection process is more computationally intensive than random initialization,
# especially when dealing with larger datasets.
# Still Some Randomness: While it generally leads to better results, the initial step still involves randomness, which
# means results can vary across different runs.
